    Unfortunately, it has been archived on March 1st, 2024 (https://github.com/sadellie/unitto) without any notice or explanation. Since there has been no activity from sadellie on GitHub since then, I guess they are not actively working on projects anymore. I will maintain this app, but I do not plan to add new features. I don't have enough time to do that, but you are welcome to contribute. I will review and merge your pull requests.

# Support NumberHub

## Contribute to the project

Add a new feature or fix bugs.

## Add translations

To add a translation, update the strings in `core/base/src/main/res/LANG/strings.xml` and open a PR

## Donate

It might sound crazy, but if you would just donate 1$, it would totally mean to world to me, since
it's a really small amount and if everyone did that, I can totally focus on NumberHub
and my other open source projects. :)

You can donate via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Myzel394)
